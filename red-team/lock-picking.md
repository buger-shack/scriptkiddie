## Pick a Lock

{% hint style="info" %}
Lock picking is a non-destructive way to bypass a lock without using a key. This can be done through a variety of different ways lock picking techniques, such as single pin picking and raking; however, each technique has the same goal in mindâ€”to mimic the action of the key.

*In essence, lock picking is simply the act of mimicking the key by manipulating the pins to the same state they would be at if the correct key were inserted.*

## How to pick a Lock : Single Pin Picking Technique

1. **Step 1: Apply Tension to Create the First Binding Pin**

   1. Start by inserting the short end of your tension wrench into the bottom of the keyway and applying very light tension to the plug. Be certain to maintain this pressure on your tension wrench throughout the entire process of picking the lock.

2. **Step 2: Locate the First Binding Pin**

   1. Because the binding pin will have more "binding" force on it than the other pins, **the binding pin will be stiffer and harder to lift than the other non-binding pins.** So basically, you are just looking for a pin that is not loose!

   2. Insert your hook-type pick into the keyway and push it all the way to the back of the lock until you locate the rearmost pin. Very gently, begin to raise each pin and gauge how it feels.

   3. Continue to probe each pin until you find the pin that doesn't feel like the others and is more difficult to move.

3. **Step 3: Lift and Set the First Binding Pin**
   1. Gently lift the binding pin until you feel a slight rotation on the plug or hear an audible click. Either of these two indicators typically indicates a successfully set driver pin!
4. **Step 4: Locate and Set the Second Binding Pin**
   1. Repeat the same steps of gently lifting each pin until you once again locate another pin that feels stiff and difficult to move. As before, gently continue to raise that pin until you feel a slight rotation on the plug or hear an audible click.

5. **Step 5: Repeat the Process of Locating and Setting Binding Pins**

   1. Continue the process of locating binding pins and lifting them to the shear line. Once every pin has been set, there will no longer be any obstruction to the shear line the plug will fully rotate and the lock will open!

## The Raking Technique

{% hint style="info" %}

The easiest way to pick a lock. 

**Raking is a very volatile and radical style of picking whose goal is to bump as many pins to the shear line as possible in the quickest amount of time.**

While it can be a lot of fun and is a very quick method of bypassing many basic locks, it will only get you so far and can become almost worthless when you start getting into locks with additional security features such as sidebars and security pins.

{% endhint %}

**With a decent amount of speed, begin to scrub the pins as if you are scrubbing the top of your teeth with your toothbrush.** 

If the lock doesn't open within 10 seconds, release the tension to reset the lock and begin again. It's very common to have to reset the lock several times before you successfully rake a lock.

>Be careful with your tension with raking. While you can get away with heavier tension during single pin picking, too much tension while raking can result in a broken pick.
