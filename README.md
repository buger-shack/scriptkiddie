{% hint style="success" %}
This gitbook is maintained by 2 young pentesters which is an inventory of everything we use in a daily basis and things learned about cybersecurity/pentesting these past few years. We will try our best to update the gitbook alongside with new challanges that we meet.



You will find basic to advanced techniques/methods/informations that we encountered during our work and through various CTFs on tryhackme/hackthebox.
