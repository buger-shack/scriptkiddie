# DCSync

<details>

<summary>What is the DCSync attack ?</summary>

This attack simulates the **behavior** of a **domain controller** and **asks other domain controllers to replicate information** using the **Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol** (MS-DRSR). Basically, it lets you **pretend to be a domain controller** and ask for user password data. This can be used by attackers to get any accountâ€™s NTLM hash including the KRBTGT account, which enables attackers to create **Golden Tickets.**

The only pre-requisite to worry about is that you have an account with **rights** to perform **domain replication**. This is controlled by the Replicating Changes permissions set on the domain.
