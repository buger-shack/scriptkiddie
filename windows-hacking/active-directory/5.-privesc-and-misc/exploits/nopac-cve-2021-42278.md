## Brief

This CVE is a security **bypass vulnerability** that is caused by **Kerberos’s PAC confusion** and impersonation of domain controllers.

It allows potential attackers to impersonate domain controllers by requesting TGT’s from Kerberos without a PAC, and the moment TGT is issued without issuing PACs, the attacker can impersonate as a highly privileged user.

Now, to get a DC to add a PAC when a service ticket (ST) was requested using a TGT without a PAC was achieved by configuring the “altSecurityIdentities“ attribute.

This process involves modifying the altSecurityIdentities attribute of an account in a foreign domain to Kerberos:\[samaccountname]@\[domain] to impersonate that user.
