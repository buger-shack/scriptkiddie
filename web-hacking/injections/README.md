# ðŸ’‰ Injections

There are several types of injections that attackers can use to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. Some of the most common include:

1. SQL injection: This occurs when an attacker is able to insert SQL commands into an application's database queries, allowing them to manipulate or extract sensitive data from the database.
2. Cross-site scripting (XSS) injection: This occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web page that is executed by a victim's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data or take control of the victim's session.
3. Command injection: This occurs when an attacker is able to inject operating system commands into an application, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
4. LDAP injection: This occurs when an attacker is able to inject LDAP commands into an application, allowing them to manipulate or extract sensitive data from the application's directory services.
