<summary>What is RCE ?</summary>

If an attacker **gains control** of a target computer through some sort of vulnerability, and they also gain the power to **execute commands on that remote computer** this process is called **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

* It is one of the cyber-attacks where an attacker can remotely execute commands on someoneâ€™s computer
* It usually occurs due to malicious malware downloaded by the host and can happen regardless of the geographic location of the device.

**How is it possible ?**

_With RCE, hackers can edit or destroy important files, steal confidential data, perform DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, and compromise the entire system._

**The attacks can be occurred due to:**

* _External user input unchecked_
* _Access control is poor_
* _Authentication measures are not properly done_
* _Buffer overflow._
