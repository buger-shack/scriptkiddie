**Why Online Privacy is important ?**

Privacy is your right.

Technology has improved and so **laws** regarding internet privacy have improved as well. Whenever you’re online, **websites aren’t allowed to store your private information** without your permission. In cases where your information is stored, such as on Amazon, these websites aren’t allowed to share that information to third parties.

Many privacy rights have extended to social media. Any information posted on social media can’t be shared without your permission, and can’t be used in any way other than what you’ve given consent for. Permission is everything. Even information posted publicly is protected by you.

Many countries have even implemented Online Erasure which eliminates harmful content & digital trails. This is especially useful in protecting minors.

It’s your right, but you must be active in making sure that right is enforced. Practicing your privacy rights protects you, especially online where the concept of privacy doesn’t seem to exist.
