**Why Online Privacy is important ?**

Privacy is your right.

Technology has improved and so **laws** regarding internet privacy have improved as well. Whenever youâ€™re online, **websites arenâ€™t allowed to store your private information** without your permission. In cases where your information is stored, such as on Amazon, these websites arenâ€™t allowed to share that information to third parties.

Many privacy rights have extended to social media. Any information posted on social media canâ€™t be shared without your permission, and canâ€™t be used in any way other than what youâ€™ve given consent for. Permission is everything. Even information posted publicly is protected by you.

Many countries have even implemented Online Erasure which eliminates harmful content & digital trails. This is especially useful in protecting minors.

Itâ€™s your right, but you must be active in making sure that right is enforced. Practicing your privacy rights protects you, especially online where the concept of privacy doesnâ€™t seem to exist.
