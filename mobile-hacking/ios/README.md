## Jailbreak

{% hint style="info" %}
_Jailbreaking iPhones and iPads are common among Apple users who want to install apps that aren't available through Apple's official channels._

Apps are frequently posted on **Cydia** and other jailbroken device download sites by developers who don't want to go through Apple's review process or follow Apple's AppStore guidelines.

Jailbreaking can also be used to get around **Digital Rights Management** (DRM) and share **copyrighted media** and gain access to **restricted file systems**, **user interfaces**, and **network capabilities**.

* **Tethered jailbreaks** don't persist through reboots, so re-applying jailbreaks requires the device to be connected (tethered) to a computer during every reboot. The device may not reboot at all if the computer is not connected.
* **Semi-tethered jailbreaks** can't be re-applied unless the device is connected to a computer during reboot. The device can also boot into non-jailbroken mode on its own.
* **Semi-untethered jailbreaks** allow the device to boot on its own, but the kernel patches (or user-land modifications) for disabling code signing aren't applied automatically. The user must re-jailbreak the device by starting an app or visiting a website (not requiring a connection to a computer, hence the term untethered).
* **Untethered jailbreaks** are the most popular choice for end users because they need to be applied only once, after which the device will be permanently jailbroken.
