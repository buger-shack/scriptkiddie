# BLE Locks Hacking

## STiD

> STiD Readers have BLE activated. Most of the times (on recent ones), you can use this technology to pass a door with STiD reader using your phone (with the badge in your phone).

### Scan

```bash
# LINUX
blescan

# Mobile
# Application STiD Settings & STiD Mobile ID
```

### Relay Attacks

> **Physical.** \
> You can grab badges access BUT someone (at least 1) in the room has to use their phone as a virtual badge for that to work.
