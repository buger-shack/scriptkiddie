# \[CVE-2021-4034] - Pwnkit

## Brief

{% hint style="info" %}
Discovered in **January 2022**

**Polkit** can be used to determine whether you have the requisite **permissions** to **execute something**. It is integrated with systemd and is much more configurable than the traditional sudo system. Sometimes referred to as the "sudo of systemd", providing a granular system with which to assign permissions to users.
