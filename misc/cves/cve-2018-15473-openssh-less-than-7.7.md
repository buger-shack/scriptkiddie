## Exploit

By sending a malformed public key authentication message to an OpenSSH server, the existence of a particular username can be ascertained. If the user does not exist, an authentication failure message will be sent to the client. In case the user exists, failure to parse the message will abort the communication: the connection will be closed without sending back any message.

```bash
# https://github.com/epi052/cve-2018-15473
./ssh-username-enum.py -u root <target>
./ssh-username-enum.py -w users.txt -v <target>
```
