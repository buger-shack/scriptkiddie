# üí∞ Ransomwares

## Brief

{% hint style="info" %}
Ransomware is a type of **malicious software**, or malware, that **prevents you from accessing your computer files, systems, or networks and demands you pay a ransom for their return**. Ransomware attacks can cause costly disruptions to operations and the loss of critical information and data.

You can unknowingly download ransomware onto a computer by **opening an email attachment, clicking an ad, following a link, or even visiting a website that's embedded with malware**.

Once the code is loaded on a computer, it will lock access to the computer itself or data and files stored there. More menacing versions can encrypt files and folders on local drives, attached drives, and even networked computers.

Most of the time, you don‚Äôt know your computer has been infected. You usually discover it when you can no longer access your data or you see computer messages letting you know about the attack and demanding ransom payments.

### How does it work ?

You might think you‚Äôve received an email from someone you know and click on what looks like a legitimate attachment. But you‚Äôve been fooled. The email is from a cybercriminal, and the file you clicked on ‚Äî and downloaded and opened ‚Äî has gone on to install malware on your device.

When you execute the program, the malware can spread to other files and damage your computer.

How? It varies. Trojans are designed to do different things. But you‚Äôll probably wish they weren‚Äôt doing any of them on your device. Common types of Trojan malware, from A to Z

### Types of Trojan

Here‚Äôs a look at some of the most common types of Trojan malware, including their names and what they do on your computer:

#### Backdoor Trojan

This Trojan can create a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù on your computer. It lets an attacker access your computer and control it. Your data can be downloaded by a third party and stolen. Or more malware can be uploaded to your device.

#### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack Trojan

This Trojan performs DDoS attacks. The idea is to take down a network by flooding it with traffic. That traffic comes from your infected computer and others.

#### Downloader Trojan

This Trojan targets your already-infected computer. It downloads and installs new versions of malicious programs. These can include Trojans and adware.

#### Fake AV Trojan

This Trojan behaves like antivirus software, but demands money from you to detect and remove threats, whether they‚Äôre real or fake.

#### Game-thief Trojan

The losers here may be online gamers. This Trojan seeks to steal their account information.

#### Infostealer Trojan

As it sounds, this Trojan is after data on your infected computer.

#### Mailfinder Trojan

This Trojan seeks to steal the email addresses you‚Äôve accumulated on your device.

#### Ransom Trojan

This Trojan seeks a ransom to undo damage it has done to your computer. This can include blocking your data or impairing your computer‚Äôs performance.

#### Remote Access Trojan

This Trojan can give an attacker full control over your computer via a remote network connection. Its uses include stealing your information or spying on you.

#### Rootkit Trojan

A rootkit aims to hide or obscure an object on your infected computer. The idea? To extend the time a malicious program runs on your device.

#### SMS Trojan

This type of Trojan infects your mobile device and can send and intercept text messages. Texts to premium-rate numbers can drive up your phone costs.

#### Trojan banker

This Trojan takes aim at your financial accounts. It‚Äôs designed to steal your account information for all the things you do online. That includes banking, credit card, and bill pay data.

#### Trojan IM

This Trojan targets instant messaging. It steals your logins and passwords on IM platforms.

**That‚Äôs just a sample. There are a lot more.**

### Examples of Trojan malware attacks

Trojan malware attacks can inflict a **lot of damage**. At the same time, Trojans continue to evolve. Here are three examples :

#### Rakhni Trojan

This malware has been around since 2013. More recently, it can deliver ransomware or a cryptojacker (allowing criminals to use your device to mine for cryptocurrency) to infected computers. ‚ÄúThe growth in coin mining in the final months of 2017 was immense,‚Äù the 2018 Internet Security Threat Report notes. ‚ÄúOverall coin-mining activity increased by 34,000 percent over the course of the year.‚Äù

#### ZeuS/Zbot

This banking Trojan is another oldie but baddie. ZeuS/Zbot source code was first released in 2011. It uses keystroke logging ‚Äî recording your keystrokes as you log into your bank account, for instance ‚Äî to steal your credentials and perhaps your account balance as well.

### Protection

{% hint style="info" %}
After you **suspect** a Trojan infection on your system, you must immediately take the actions to **remove** it quickly so that the damage could be control. You can do that either **manually** or using an **antimalware program**.

Following steps can be taken to get rid of Trojans from the system manually :

* **Recognize** which application or service is causing the trouble. For that, you can take the help of the Task Manager and look for the application or process using system resources abnormally.
* **Stop** the system restore so that the files you erase couldn't be recover.
* **Reboot** the device in Safe Mode to control the Trojan.
* **Remove** the **suspected programs** from the system. You must be careful while removing the programs, as removing a legit system app can enhance the problem.
* **Clear** your **device junks** like Temporary Folder and Recycle Bin.

If you don't want to take the trouble of removing the Trojan manually, you can take the help of a security program. It is advised to use the antimalware solution to remove malware entirely from the system as it would thoroughly scan the entire system.
{% endhint %}

### Avoid them

Removing Trojans is a great way to safeguard your computer and privacy, but you must also take steps to avoid them in the future :

* **Setup** Cloud accounts using email addresses that offers account recovery support. Accounts from ISP‚Äôs or paid services.
* In the case of **Apple**, you can request assistance to help recover an account (Gmail and/or yahoo accounts can‚Äôt be recovered as they can‚Äôt confirm ownership)
* Use **VPNs** on **Public Wi-Fi**
* Call the Sender Before Opening Email Attachments
* Use an **Antivirus** Solution With Real-Time Protection
