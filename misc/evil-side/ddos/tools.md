## `Slowloris`&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Slowloris tool is used to make a DDoS attack. It is used to make the server down.

**Features**:

* Sends authorized HTTP traffic to the server.
* Doesnâ€™t affect other services and ports on the target network.
* This attack tries to keep the maximum connection engaged with those that are open.
* Achieves this by sending a partial request.
* Tries to hold the connections as long as possible.
* As the server keeps the false connection open, this will overflow the connection pool and will deny the request to the true connections.

**Verdict**: As it makes the attack at a slow rate, traffic can be easily detected as abnormal and can be blocked.
